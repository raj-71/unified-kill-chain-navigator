# Unified Kill Chain Navigator & Comparison Tool

In this project we have created a cyber attack or APT groupâ€™s report mapping and comparison tool. We took inspiration from MITRE ATT&CK Navigator Tool and created its modified version based on The Unified Kill Chain by Paul Pols. Comparison of multiple mapped reports can be done visually on a tactical level of abstraction. The analysis and observations gained after comparison is expected to offer a substantiated basis for realigning defensive capabilities and investments within organizations and to allow for the improvement of the predictive value of Red Team threat emulations.
